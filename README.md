## Snowpark R&D

## Key Points on Snowpark 

1: Snowpqark does not require a separate cluster outside of the  Snowflake,  and all computations run within Snowflake.\
2: Here core abstraction of Snowpark is Dataframe\
3: Snowpark is an API that helps to query data in Snowflake. It can be leveraged to build data pipelines.\
4: While executing snowpark commands, we will not move data out of Snowflake. \
5: Dataframe represents the data stored in Database.\
6: Dataframe offers methods to process the data.\
7: Snowpark uses snowflake warehouse in order to process the data.
